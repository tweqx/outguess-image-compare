## Outguess Image Compare
A tool created to check

## Typical use case
Often, 3301 produced from one source image two different files embedding Outguess messages. Examples of pairs of such files are the "everywhere" images from 2012, or the "cicada.jpg" files from 845145127.com.

Unfortunately, it is often the case that only one image of such pairs had been archived properly. And interestingly, years later an archive of the missing image was found but lacked tracability as to where it came from.

In such situations, this tool can be run on the pair of images. It will report any discrepancies. If none are found, the pair of images are legitimate with an high probability - as long as one image of the pair can be traced to being legitimate, of course.

## How does it work?
This tool runs two series of check.

The first one is simply based on metadata analysis and can detect if the metadata present in each image could have possibly been generated by Outguess. This first check is ran on both images.

The second one checks whether an invariant is presented for both imageis. This invariant is normally preserved by Outguess and is very difficult to recreate without having access to the original source image, on which Outguess is ran.

## Building
Run `make`.
